# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2022


**Today's Progress**: I continued the mooc program of python. Currently i'm in part 5 section 2 learning about references. Keep doing more excercises about lists and matrices.

**Thoughts:** Important to not forget about references when copying arrays, matrices, etc

### Day 1: February 21, 2022


**Today's Progress**: I'm still in part 5 module 2 of the python mooc course. I did a module for a tic-toe game. Pretty awesome.



### Day 2: February 22, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Did a couple exercises about matrices but have problems with one about a reverse matrix

**Thoughts:** I need to do some more exercise about recorring matrices. 


### Day 3: February 23, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Learn about python dictionaries and did some exercises about them.

**Thoughts:** When doing some major exercises i struggle to eficiently resolved them. I´m trying to stop, identify each minimun problem to solve and doing reusable function. I need to keep working on that. I guess that with time and after doing some big projects i would master it ;) .

### Day 4: February 23, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Continued doing some dictionaries exercise and learn about remmoving keys and theis values. Struggled a little bit with printing a list of a dictionary especific key.

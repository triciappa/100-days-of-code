# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2022


**Today's Progress**: I continued the mooc program of python. Currently i'm in part 5 section 2 learning about references. Keep doing more excercises about lists and matrices.

**Thoughts:** Important to not forget about references when copying arrays, matrices, etc

**Link to work:** 

- [Sudoku exercise](https://github.com/triciappa/Python-Programming-MOOC/blob/main/Part%205/Exercise%202.3.py)

### Day 1: February 21, 2022


**Today's Progress**: I'm still in part 5 module 2 of the python mooc course. I did a module for a tic-toe game. Pretty awesome.



### Day 2: February 22, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Did a couple exercises about matrices but have problems with one about a reverse matrix

**Thoughts:** I need to do some more exercise about recorring matrices.
